##PowerShellOnePrompt##
#One PowerShell Prompt to rule them all#
This is a Powershell startup script to enable different evnironments and different modes for withing Windows

There are five different modes
* Default
* EndUser
* Developer
* SharePoint
* Admin

#Configuring#
To setup the prompt you need to copy it to the PowerShell startup directory. For many Window users you will need
to create a directory in your Documents direcotry, WindowsPowerShell and copy the Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1.

This is the profile that will execute each time PowerShell is started. Note, if you have yet to do so, you
may need to configure scripts to run

'''
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
'''



It makes me crazy not to have GacUtil and SharePoint PowerShell scripts available in prompt

Have created a prompt to solve
